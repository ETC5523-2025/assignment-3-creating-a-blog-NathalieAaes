    "text": "My name is Nathalie Aaes-Jørgensen, and I am pursuing a Master of Science in Actuarial Mathematics at the University of Copenhagen. I am currently spending my final semester on exchange at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. Going on exchange has always been a dream of mine, as I love traveling and experiencing new cultures. Australia was an obvious choice, and Monash stood out as the only university in the country accredited by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.\nGiven the small size of Denmark, only 60 students are admitted to the Bachelor of Actuarial Mathematics program each year, which means we quickly become very close. It was thus a natural choice for me to join the committee for our sports events and parties, StatAct, and to serve as a tutor planing the social events and a four-day outing for new students. Although time-consuming, these experiences have been incredibly rewarding and have provided me with skills and memories I would not want to be without.\nAlongside my studies, I work part-time at Gjensidige Forsikring, a leading Nordic non-life insurance company. I am part of the Enterprise Data Products Denmark department, where I have developed skills in Power BI, GitHub, and SQL, while working within a scrum framework.\nIn my free time, I enjoy swimming, ballroom dancing, cooking, trying out new restaurants, and spending time with my friends, family and my boyfriend of seven years."

    "text": "Insights from the Study\n\nThe Data Behind the Numbers\nZacher et al.’s study dives into data from the 2011 German point prevalence survey (PPS), which was part of a larger effort by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, covering 29 EU/EEA countries. Germany was benchmarked against the European average by considering three different datasets:\n\nA representative sample: 46 hospitals and 9,626 patients\n\nA bigger convenience sample: 132 hospitals and 41,539 patients\n\nEU/EEA-wide data for comparison: 1,149 hospitals and 273,753 patients\n\nYou can explore the data yourself in the BHAI R-package.\n\n\nDigging into the Numbers\nBy combining these datasets, five major HAIs were examined, including how many deaths they caused, and the overall health impact measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).\n\n\n\n\n\nType of HAI(95% CI)\n\n\nNumber of HAIs(95% CI)\n\n\nAttributable deaths(95% CI)\n\n\nDALYs(95% CI)\n\n\nYLLs(95% CI)\n\n\nYLDs(95% CI)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHAP\n\n\n106,586(83,618–137,476)\n\n\n3,968(1,107–8,164)\n\n\n69,508(34,042–117,232)\n\n\n41,306(11,475–84,483)\n\n\n27,539(16,528–42,824)\n\n\n\n\nSSI\n\n\n93,222(75,369–114,241)\n\n\n2,328(1,888–2,882)\n\n\n28,842(23,313–35,303)\n\n\n28,376(22,983–34,714)\n\n\n452(352–580)\n\n\n\n\nBSI\n\n\n26,976(16,520–42,252)\n\n\n3,905(2,004–6,987)\n\n\n58,350(30,940–104,227)\n\n\n49,578(25,499–90,816)\n\n\n8,787(4,463–16,609)\n\n\n\n\nUTI\n\n\n214,150(175,086–253,524)\n\n\n3,664(1,462–7,533)\n\n\n66,701(27,890–128,543)\n\n\n44,871(18,043–92,915)\n\n\n20,243(8,095–40,522)\n\n\n\n\nUTI\n\n\n36,002(25,108–49,934)\n\n\n1,917(112–4,547)\n\n\n20,890(2,023–49,443)\n\n\n19,937(1,166–47,973)\n\n\n977(172–2,125)\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n478,222(421,350–537,787)\n\n\n16,245(10,863–22,756)\n\n\n248,920(178,693–336,239)\n\n\n190,245(131,301–264,573)\n\n\n59,076(40,263–84,578)\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Estimated burden of five common hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) in Germany, 2011. Interestingly, HAP (106,586) and BSI (26,976) together made up only 28% of all HAIs (69,508+58,350), but they accounted for 51% of total DALYs. On the other hand, UTI (214,150) were more frequent (45% of cases) but contributed just 27% of DALYs (66,701). This highlights the different severity and impact of each infection type. Estimates include 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and cover infections in acute-care hospital settings. Source: Zacher et al.\n\n\nLooking closer at Table 1, HAP and BSI clearly punch above their weight. Although they are less common than other infections, they make up a disproportionately large share of the health burden. In contrast, UTI are more frequent, yet its contribution to overall DALYs is smaller. These patterns suggest that targeting prevention efforts toward HAP and BSI could yield the biggest reductions in overall disease burden.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Annual estimated burden of five common HAIs in Germany and EU/EEA in 2011-2012. Germany had a higher overall burden (592 HAIs/100,000) than the EU/EEA average (468 HAIs/100,000), largely due to its high number of hospitalised patients. UTIs and CDI contributed disproportionately to Germany’s burden, while HAP contributed relatively less. The estimates include 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and reflect infections in acute-care hospital settings. Source: Zacher et al.\n\n\n\nExtending the comparison to the EU/EEA, Figure 1 shows that Germany experienced a higher burden per 100,000 population: 592 versus 468. This difference mainly reflects Germany’s large number of hospital beds and hospitalised patients, which increases population-level burden even when hospital-level prevalence is relatively low. Patterns also varied by infection type: HAP contributed less to Germany’s total DALYs than the EU/EEA average, while UTIs and CDI made up a larger share.\nBeyond differences by infection type and country, the burden of HAIs in Germany is driven primarily by mortality. About 72% of total DALYs come from years of life lost (YLLs), compared with 28% from years lived with disability (YLDs). This indicates that HAIs often result in premature death rather than long-term disability. The highest burden was concentrated among older adults, particularly those aged 65 years and above, reflecting both their vulnerability and the large proportion of hospital patients in this age group\n\n\nLooking Above the Numbers\nZacher et al. estimate that 20–30% of HAIs are preventable through improved hygiene and infection control practices. To make such prevention efforts more effective, the new methodology and the BHAI package were introduced, providing more precise estimates of HAI burden. Preventing even a fraction of these infections can save thousands of lives and reduce healthcare costs significantly. In other words, the numbers aren’t just statistics - they point to actionable ways to protect patients."

    "text": "The Takeaway\nThe findings from Zacher et al. bring us back to where we started: hospitals are meant to make people better, not worse. However, the data shows that Germany’s burden of HAIs per 100,000 population is higher than the EU/EEA average, meaning there’s still plenty of room for improvement. The new BHAI methodology helps shine a light on where change can have the biggest impact.\nNot all infections weigh the same. HAP and BSI cause far more harm than their numbers alone suggest. Focusing prevention efforts on these two could make a real difference in reducing deaths and long-term health loss. And since an estimated 20–30% of HAIs are preventable with better hygiene and infection control, the message is clear: small changes in hospital practice can save thousands of lives."
